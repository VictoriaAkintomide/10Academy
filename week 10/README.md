Moodle Database: Educational Data Log Analysis


This week you will analyse the 2019 10 Academy learners activity in the Moodle Learning Management System. The moodle LMS is a highly scalable framework, and all students activities are stored in a highly structured database.


Your challenge: assuming a role-model of a freelancer hired by 10 Academy, you are to explore the 10 Academy Moodle logs stored in the database together with many other relevant tables. By the end of your analysis, you are expected to build a Tableau dashboard that illustrates the progress of students across time.
